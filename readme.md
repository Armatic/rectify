# Rectify

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/andypike/rectify/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/andypike/rectify)

Rectify is a gem that provides some lightweight classes that will make it easier
to build Rails applications in a more maintainable way. It's built on top of
several other gems and adds improved APIs to make things easier.

Rectify is an extraction from a number of projects that I've worked on and used
these techniques.

To install, add it to your `Gemfile`:

```
gem "rectify"
```

Then use Bundler to install it:

```
bundle install
```
